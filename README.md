# April, Heather, Sue Team Project 

### Problem Statement

Currently there is no REST (Representational State Transfer) API that we could find that 
offered quick and easy food expiration information. Our mission is to create a REST API 
that returns the expiration time by category and food item.


### Project Technologies/Techniques 

* JSOUP - a java html parser (extract and manipulate data from URL or HTML file)
  * Parse http://www.eatbydate.com/ to extract simple food expiration lengths
* Jersey - the open source, production quality, JAX-RS (JSR 311) Reference Implementation 
  for building RESTful Web services
* Jackson - a multi-purpose Java library for processing JSON data format
* JSON
* Logging
  * logging using Log4J. 
* Unit Testing
  * JUnit tests
